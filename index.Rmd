## Pie Chart
#### The pie chart below visually shows the top 15 countries which has the highest death rate due to COVID-19. Percentage of how every country's death rate is distributed to all 15 countries is labelled on the chart. The chart shows that Yemen has a much greater death rate than other countries. Pie chart is chosen because it can be visualized simpler than other types of graphs as size of the circle can be made proportional to the total quantity.
